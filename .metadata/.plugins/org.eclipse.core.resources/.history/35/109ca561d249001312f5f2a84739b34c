PURPOSE:
[
1)Parse XML line to line and pick all values like class and objects
2)Then Use Relection to map the specify values to the objects
3)Then Compare MyAllTypesFirst.java and MyAllTypesSecond.java for unique instances
4)Use serailize to write to output file same as first XML
5)Compare files to check whether no difference is present
]

PERCENT COMPLETE:
[
  I believe we have completed the project 100%, I have implemented entire functionality.
  According to the specific required two design patterns are applied 
  1. Strategy Design Pattern
]

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:
[
  None.

BUGS:
[
	Known bugs N/A  
]

FILES:
[

  Included with this project are 27 files:
  	Driver.java 			Driver class that calls in steps Parse, Serialize, compare only if Debug value is 0,deserialize
  	ICheckUserInput.java 	Interface that checks the input validity
	ICompareTwoClasses.java Interface that Compare two classes
	IContext.java 			Use the Context to see change in behaviour when it changes its Strategy As this interface is for Context class
	IDeSerialize.java 		Interface for Deseralize
	IParse.java 			Interface for Parse class
	ISerialize.java 		Interface for Serialize class
	IStrategy.java 			Strategy implementation of Strategy pattern
	DeSerialize.java 		DeSerialize class that uses reflection to generate classes and calls respective methodfrom the parsed data
	DeSerializeTypes.java 	DeSerialize types that provides input to DeSerialize class that uses reflection to generate classes and calls respective methodfrom the parsed data
	Serialize.java 			Serialize class that Serialize data and generate MyAllTypesCopy.txt
	SerializeTypes.java 	SerializeTypes class that contains datatypes used in Serialize class
	MyAllTypesFirst.java 	MyAllTypeFirst POJO class
	MyAllTypesSecond.java 	MyAllTypesSecond POJO class
	CallMethod.java 		One of the Implementation of Strategy pattern
	CatchWrongInputException.java User Defined exception class, That validates input data
	CheckUserInput.java 	Checks the input validity
	CompareTwoClasses.java  Compares the arraylists to find uniqueInstance
	ComplexType.java 		One of the Implementation of Strategy pattern
	Context.java 			Use the Context to see change in behaviour when it changes its Strategy
	Debug.java 				Debugger class that maintains logging information
	DPSerialization.java 	One of the Implementation of Strategy pattern
	FileReaderClass.java 	FileReaderClass tis contains objects of FileReader and BufferedReader
	Parse.java 				Parse class that parse the file data and generated the hashmap for every object
	PrimitiveTypes.java 	One of the Implementation of Strategy pattern
  	build.xml				Code for ANT compilation and for setting command line arguments.
  	README					The text file that you are currently reading.
    MyAllTypes.txt          Input file
]

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

[
	MyAllTypesCopy.txt which is same as input file MyAllTypes.txt

]

TO COMPILE:

[
  Extract the project and go to the directory(using CD Command) where you have extracted the project.
  
  Please Compile as: ant compile
  
]

TO RUN:

[
  Please run as: ant -Darg0=DataFile -Darg1=5 -Darg2=SearchFile -Darg3=5 run 
]

EXTRA CREDIT:

[
  In our code we have used Vector as the data structure to store the records. 
  Vector optimizes storage management and is efficient in terms of storage as the management is done using 
  capacity and capacitIncrement. 
  
  Size of the vector is the capacity of the vector and the capacityIncrement increases 
  the storage in chunk of size capacitIncrement. If we want to insert large number of components 
  in vector we can increase the capacity in advance by specifying or increasing size of capacityIncrement.

Program to Interface and not to concrete class

Input validation with user defined Exception handling
