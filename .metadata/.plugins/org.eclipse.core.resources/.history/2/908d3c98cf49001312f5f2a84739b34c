PURPOSE:
[
1)Parse XML line to line and pick all values like class and objects
2)Then Use Relection to map the specify values to the objects
3)Then Compare MyAllTypesFirst.java and MyAllTypesSecond.java for unique instances
4)Use serailize to write to output file same as first XML
5)Compare files to check whether no difference is present

PERCENT COMPLETE:
[
  We believe we have completed the project 100%, we have implemented entire functionality from building Design Pattern conference.
  According to the specific required two design patterns are applied 
  1. Builder Design Pattern
  2. Abstract Factory Design Pattern

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:
[
  None.

FILES:

  Included with this project are 16 files:
  
  MusicInfo.java		MusicInfo class will act like POJO.
  MusicStore.java		MusicStore class stores Data populated from DataFile which is further used in SearchWorker class.
  PopulateWorker.java	PopulateWorker creates pool of Threads that read Data from DataFile to populate MusicStore class.
  SearchWorker.java		SearchWorker class searches data from SearchFile in MusicStore and generate output to result class.
  Driver.java 			Driver class is the driver that creates objects of all Interfaces of classes and control complete 
  						program flow.
  IMusicStore.java		Interface for MusicStore class.
  IPopulateWorker.java	Interface for PopulateWorker class.
  ISearchWorker.java	Interface for SearchWorker class.
  ICreateFile.java		Interface for CreateFile class.
  IResults.java			Interface for Display class.
  CatchWrongInputException.java		User Defined exception class, that validates input data.
  CreateFile.java 		Class creates DataFile and SearchFile.
  Debug.java			Debugger class that maintains logging information.
  Results.java			Result class stores matched values and acts as Input source for output to be displayed.
  build.xml				Code for ANT compilation and for setting command line arguments.
  README				The text file that you are currently reading.

TO COMPILE:

[
  Extract the project and go to the directory(using CD Command) where you have extracted the project.
  
  Please Compile as: ant compile
  
]

TO RUN:

[
  Please run as: ant -Darg0=DataFile -Darg1=5 -Darg2=SearchFile -Darg3=5 run 
]

EXTRA CREDIT:

[
  In our code we have used Vector as the data structure to store the records. 
  Vector optimizes storage management and is efficient in terms of storage as the management is done using 
  capacity and capacitIncrement. 
  
  Size of the vector is the capacity of the vector and the capacityIncrement increases 
  the storage in chunk of size capacitIncrement. If we want to insert large number of components 
  in vector we can increase the capacity in advance by specifying or increasing size of capacityIncrement.

Program to Interface and not to concrete class

Input validation with user defined Exception handling
